# metaAsset: NFT-backed Ownership Registry

## 📘 Project Description
**metaAsset** is a decentralized ownership registry where real-world and digital assets are tokenized as NFTs.  
Each NFT acts as an immutable proof of ownership, allowing verifiable transfers, transparent history, and interoperable asset management.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a transparent, tamper-proof digital registry that bridges physical and digital ownership using blockchain technology.  
By linking real-world items (art, vehicles, real estate) or digital creations (music, 3D models, in-game assets) to NFTs, we ensure trust and authenticity across ecosystems.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **NFT-Backed Registration:** Each registered asset mints an ERC-721 NFT as proof of ownership.  
- **Decentralized Ownership Transfer:** Owners can securely transfer asset ownership on-chain.  
- **Metadata Integration:** Each NFT is linked to metadata stored on IPFS or a decentralized storage layer.  
- **Transparent Verification:** Asset details can be publicly verified via smart contract queries.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Asset Fractionalization:** Allow multiple owners to hold partial NFT stakes.  
- **Integration with Legal Frameworks:** Connect on-chain records with legal registries.  
- **Dynamic Metadata:** Support real-time asset updates (valuation, location, or condition).  
- **Cross-Chain Support:** Enable NFT-backed assets to move across multiple blockchains.  
- **AI-Powered Valuation:** Integrate predictive models to estimate asset value over time.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Solidity 0.8.20+**
- **OpenZeppelin ERC721**
- **Hardhat / Foundry for testing**
- **IPFS for decentralized storage**
