# MetaAsset

## 📌 Project Title
MetaAsset – Decentralized Tokenized Asset Management System

---

## 🧩 Project Description
**MetaAsset** is a decentralized platform that allows users to tokenize, manage, and transfer real-world or digital assets on the blockchain.  
Each asset is uniquely represented on-chain, ensuring transparency, traceability, and security.  
The platform enables secure ownership transfers, asset verification, and decentralized registry management — all powered by Ethereum smart contracts.
